The goal of my site it to share a piece of who I am in my computational media journey. I plan to make this site a portfolio of my work throughout my years at Tech. On this site, my goal is to see a steady progression in my level of expertise with HTML, CSS, and other skills. The design aesthetic of my website is meant to be professional, yet still remain fun. That is my personality, so I wanted both aspects to shine through. I chose a bubbly font because it resonated with my personality. However, I chose various shades of blue, for my color palette, because blue tends to be associated with professionalism. I used w3.css frameworks as a basis for my webpages, but hope to branch outside of that as I get more familiar with HTML and CSS. My final draft should exhibit all of my goals.
